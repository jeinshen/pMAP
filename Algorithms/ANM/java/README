How to use
==========


Only once:

javaaddpath /path/to/this/directory
import RandSep

RandSep always generates values from 0 to 1. Suppose you desire a separation
of 0.1 between points. Then, create an appropriate RandSep object:

r = RandSep(0.1);

Now, you can generate successive instances like this:

r.next()
r.next()
...

This method will return a -1 if it cannot add additional points while
maintaining desired separation.
